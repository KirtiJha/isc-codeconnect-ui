This follows the standard Salesforce LWC pattern for data fetching via wire services.\n- The `connectedCallback` lifecycle method is used to initialize the component by setting the `loading` state to `true`, indicating that data fetching is in progress.\n- The `contactId` is accessed via the parent template context, aligning with the component's design to receive data from a parent component.\n- The component properties `loading` and `noAccounts` are used to manage the display of loading and no-accounts states, respectively, in the template, adhering to best practices for state management in LWC.\n- This implementation does not include a detailed error handling mechanism beyond re-throwing Apex errors for debugging. In a production environment, more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms should be implemented.\n\nMissing Elements:\n- The Apex controller `AccountController` and its method `getAccountsByContactId` are assumed to exist and are not provided in this template. These need to be created in your Salesforce org.\n- The parent component that passes the `contactId` is not shown here but should exist and pass the `contactId` attribute to this LWC component.=== Apex Controller Generation ===\n\nOVERVIEW:\nThis Apex controller, named `AccountController`, is designed to handle the fetching of related Accounts for a given Contact. It includes a single method `getAccountsByContactId` that executes a SOQL query to retrieve all Accounts linked to a specific Contact. The controller adheres to Salesforce best practices for security, error handling, and SOQL query optimization.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n\n```Apex\n// Controller Name: AccountController\npublic with sharing class AccountController {\n\n    // Method to fetch Accounts related to a Contact by Contact ID\n    @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)\n    public static List<Account> getAccountsByContactId(Id contactId) {\n        // Use a SOQL query to fetch Accounts related to the Contact via AccountContactRelation\n        // Limit the results to 200 records to prevent hitting governor limits\n        // Order by Onboarding_VAD_Selected_Date__c DESC to show most recent first\n        List<Account> accounts = [\n            SELECT \n                Id, \n                Name, \n                CE_ID__c, \n                Phone, \n                Onboarding_VAD_Selected_Date__c, \n                (SELECT toLabel(Action_Type__c), Context__c, Contact.Name FROM Partner_Business_Events1__r WHERE Action_Type__c = 'ONBOARDING_CONTACT_MADE' LIMIT 1), \n                (SELECT Contact.Id, Contact.Email, Contact.Phone, Contact.Name FROM AccountContactRelations WHERE PRM_Roles__c INCLUDES('PRM_PRC') AND IsActive = TRUE LIMIT 1), \n                AccountEligibility__r.Eligibility_Code__c, \n                Last_Selected_Mentor__c, \n                Motion_Interests__c, \n                Introducing_Distributor__r.Name, \n                Introducing_Distributor__r.CE_ID__c, \n                Introducing_Distributor__c \n            FROM Account \n            WHERE \n                Introducing_Distributor__c IN (\n                    SELECT AccountId FROM AccountContactRelation WHERE ContactId = :contactId AND IsActive = TRUE AND Account.BP_Status__c = 'ACTIVE'\n                ) AND BP_Status__c = 'ACTIVE'\n            ORDER BY Onboarding_VAD_Selected_Date__c DESC\n            LIMIT 200\n        ];\n\n        // Check for query results and handle accordingly\n        if (accounts.isEmpty()) {\n            return new List<Account>();\n        }\n        return accounts;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCONTEXT REFERENCES:\n- The controller method `getAccountsByContactId` aligns with the provided SOQL query pattern for fetching Accounts related to a Contact.\n- The `@AuraEnabled` annotation ensures that this method can be called from an Aura-enabled interface, such as a Lightning Web Component (LWC).\n- The query includes various relationships and fields as specified in the context, ensuring adherence to the provided schema.\n- Security is maintained by using the `with sharing` keyword, ensuring that all data access respects the user's sharing model.\n- Error handling is implicit in Apex's SOQL execution model, which automatically handles governor limit exceptions and null results.\n\nNote: This controller does not include explicit error handling beyond Apex's built-in mechanisms. In a production environment, additional logging or custom error messages might be necessary for debugging or user feedback.=== Component Implementation Summary ===\n\nOVERVIEW:\nThis LWC component, named `contactAccounts`, is designed to fetch and display all related Accounts for a given Contact. It integrates the Carbon Design System components for rendering the list and modal, ensuring a consistent user interface. The component leverages Salesforce's standard `Account` and `Contact` objects, utilizing their relationship to retrieve the necessary data.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:\n\n1. **HTML Template**:\n   - The template uses conditional rendering to display a loading state, a structured list of Accounts, or a message indicating no Accounts are found.\n   - It employs Carbon Design System components (`c-carbon-layer`, `c-carbon-structured-list`, `c-carbon-structured-list-row`, `c-carbon-structured-list-cell`) to maintain visual consistency and adhere to design guidelines.\n   - The template receives the `contactId` from its parent component via the `contact-id` attribute.\n\n2. **JavaScript Controller**:\n   - The controller uses the `@wire` decorator to invoke an Apex method (`getAccountsByContactId`) from the `AccountController`, adhering to standard LWC practices for data fetching via wire services.\n   - The `connectedCallback` lifecycle method initializes the component by setting the `loading` state to `true`, indicating data fetching is in progress.\n   - The `contactId` is accessed via the parent template context, aligning with the component's design to receive data from a parent component.\n   - Component properties `loading` and `noAccounts` manage the display of loading and no-accounts states, respectively, in the template.\n\n3. **Apex Controller**:\n   - The `AccountController` includes a single method `getAccountsByContactId` that executes a SOQL query to retrieve all Accounts linked to a specific Contact.\n   - The query utilizes the `AccountContactRelation` object to establish the relationship between Contacts and Accounts, ensuring only active Accounts are returned.\n   - The method is annotated with `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)`, allowing it to be called from an LWC and enabling result caching for improved performance.\n\nDEPLOYMENT NOTES:\n\n- Ensure the `AccountController` and its `getAccountsByContactId` method are deployed to your Salesforce org.\n- The parent component passing the `contactId` to this LWC component must be in place and correctly configured.\n- Test the component thoroughly in different Salesforce environments (Sandbox, Developer, Production) to ensure compatibility and performance.\n\nTESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. **Unit Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests to validate the component's behavior under various conditions, such as when no Accounts are found, when multiple Accounts exist, and when the Apex method call fails.\n   - Use Lightning Web Component Testing Library for creating test cases.\n\n2. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Test the component within the context of the parent component to ensure proper data flow and rendering.\n   - Verify that the component correctly handles edge cases, such as when the `contactId` is invalid or missing.\n\n3. **Performance Testing**:\n   - Assess the component's performance, especially when dealing with a large number of Accounts, to ensure it meets Salesforce governor limits and provides a responsive user experience.\n   - Consider implementing pagination or lazy loading if performance becomes an issue with a high volume of data.",
